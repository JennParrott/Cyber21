# Cyber21

Hi Cyber-World
I am Jenn, I cook, clean and IT. In the process of learning more about cybersecurity.  I am a jack of all trades in IT.  I feel the more you know the better you can support your users and team. I am not a very wordie person, I like to keep it simple.  Kinda like how to troubleshoot, try the most simple thing first.
